    "1. Does Accuracy Fall Off After 63%?\n",
    "Observations:\n",
    "The contingency table shows the number of correct (True) and incorrect (False) predictions for similarity scores above and below 63%:\n",
    "    - Below 63%: 5,423 incorrect vs. 1,828 correct.\n",
    "    - Above 63%: 4 incorrect vs. 11 correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis:\n",
    "    - For scores above 63%, the proportion of correct predictions is higher (11/15 ≈ 73%) compared to scores below 63% (1,828/7,251 ≈ 25%).\n",
    "    - This suggests accuracy does not fall off after 63%. In fact, it improves significantly above this threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Does Similarity and Accuracy Have a Relationship?\n",
    "Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi2 Value: 15.881\n",
    "P-Value: 0.000\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "A significant p-value (e.g., < 0.05) means there is evidence that similarity scores and correctness are not independent, confirming a relationship between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chi-Sqaure does not imply model performance**:\n",
    "The chi-squared test does not measure how good or bad the model's predictions are at any threshold.\n",
    "It only verifies whether higher or lower similarity scores are associated with being correct.\n",
    "This indicates a statistically significant relationship between similarity scores (above or below 63%) and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "1. Key Transition Point: Around the threshold >30 where Precision spikes to 1.0 and Recall drops sharply, there is a clear trade-off. This is a critical threshold to consider:\n",
    "Below this point: Predictions are more inclusive (high Recall, low Precision).\n",
    "Above this point: Predictions are more exclusive (low Recall, high Precision).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Precision remains constant at 0 for all thresholds greater than 63. This suggests that there are no or very few true positives being predicted correctly beyond this threshold, likely because the threshold is too high to classify any similarity score as \"positive.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lets assume a similarity threshold range of >30 to <=60 is acceptable for subsequent analysis\n"
