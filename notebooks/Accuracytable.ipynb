    "From the given tables we can conclude that all of the given issues with accuracy are happening due to the discrepancies that occur due the mismatch with the matches and the expected output being different logic wise. For the model the suggested matches are good and if you look at the suggestion then they would make sense as they match the given query. But looking at the expected output you will notice that the labels are much different showing that the given labels don't match the NLP logic e.g. the query has manpower and it would mean that the expected should be related but it says other, showing that natural language matching does not prove good for this dataset\n",

    "1. The first suggestion would be that we should ask the shareholders if the system can be changed for the models where having much cleaner data could allow us to not have to retrain the model and use something like reinforcement learning to make the model understand the pattern\n",
    "2. The next thing that can be tried is that the model can be changed to use supervised learning to force it to understand the pattern as it will not force the change of the entire system for the shareholders as that can be a hassle but this may cause us to retrain and have over-fitting issues as the patterns do not have a proper logic\n",
    "3. An option to use random forrest could work better on this dataset type as it works like a multi general pattern recognizer where many learn general patterns but not specific use cases and each learns a slightly different pattern so it would not need to retrain or change the dataset"
